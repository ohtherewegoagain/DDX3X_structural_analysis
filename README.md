# DDX3X Structural Analysis Repository

This repository contains the data, scripts, and manuscript files supporting the structural and dynamic analysis of the human DDX3X protein (UniProt ID: O00571), focusing on the L556S and L559H mutations. The study integrates covariation analysis, AlphaFold modeling, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate mutation-induced perturbations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Figure files are embedded within the LaTeX manuscript and not included separately here.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed data files (e.g., FASTA sequences, PDB structures).
- `scripts/`: Analysis scripts for homolog filtering, MSA, covariation, mutation generation, MD setup, and visualization.
- `supplementary/`: Supplementary tables and text (e.g., statistical summary).
